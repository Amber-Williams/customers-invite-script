## About the script

I created this script using Node and tested with Jest. Throughout the build I kept an inheritance programming design pattern in mind. 

You may notice there is two distance calculations on the distance object for each customer in the `customer-invite.json`. The reason for this is I wanted to show that there are two forumulas for calculating distance on the globe. I would recommend using the other more readable Haversine formula because this computation has only a slight drawback when calculating distances where milimeters in sizing matters. Verses Vincentry's computationally intensive formula which is less performant when considering compute usage.
